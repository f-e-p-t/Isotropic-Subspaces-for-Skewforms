# Isotropic-Subspaces-for-Skewforms
Work in progress - computes d(F, n, k) for prime-order fields (see 'Isotropic Subspaces for Skewforms and Maximal Abelian Subgroups of p-Groups', Buhler, Gupta, Harris, 1987).

You will need to specify the dimension dim_W of the subspaces you want to test against the k bilinear forms. For small values, there will only be a few. d(F, n, k) is the largest value of dim_W such that the number of collections of k bilinear forms tested aligns with the number of those which have a dim_W-dimensional isotropic subspace.
